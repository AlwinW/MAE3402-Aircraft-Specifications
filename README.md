Aircraft performance of a twin engine electric aircraft

This code is used to assess the specifications of final designs for the proposal outlined in the MAE3402 Request For Proposal (RFL) document.

## Request for Propsal
Carry out preliminary design of a battery-powered 6-seat unpressurised commuter aircraft capable of 1000 km range.
### Requirements
The requirements below must be satisfied at maximum aircraft weight unless otherwise stated.
- **Payload and crew** Maximum payload for 1000 km range is one aircrew and five passengers each with standard size cabin baggage, 120 kg total mass per person. Ferry range payload: pilot and baggage, total 120 kg.
- **Design mission** 1000 km range, cruising at 10 000 ft altitude, M = 0.25 airspeed. Range includes take-off and landing segments, no loiter allowance.
- **Power** Two electric motors of equal size, energised by advanced-chemistry rechargeable Li-ion batteries with anticipated specific energy 1 MJ/kg. Batteries must be removeable for recycling and replacement.
- **Service ceiling** 12 000 ft with minimum rate of climb 100 ft/min at this altitude.
- **Climb** Minimum 2nd-segment climb gradient 1.5% with one engine inoperative. Minimum rate of climb at cruise altitude: 300 ft/min.
- **Takeoff and landing** 1 km maximum of paved runway. Additional minimum ground distance allowed to 35 ft screen height: 200m. Maximum landing approach speed: 100 kt.
- **Load factors** −1.5 ≤ n ≤ 3.5.
- **General certification** basis CASR Part 23
